/**
 * Transforms a number to 'byte' array.
 * Remember that 'byte' array is just a 'hexadecimal number split by whitespaces if console logged'.

 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Represent our input as 8-bytes array, can be done with ArrayBuffer.
 * 2. Buffer starts from the right, so we read backwards.
 * 3. Will return a result in 'bytes'.
 *
 * @param num - Number to be transformed into bytes.
 * @returns ArrayBuffer consists of numbers.
